I am a data professional in a data consulting firm called Automatidata. Their client, the New
York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (New York City TLC), was impressed with the work you
have done and has requested that you build a machine learning model to predict if a customer will
not leave a tip. They want to use the model in an app that will alert taxi drivers to customers who
are unlikely to tip, since drivers depend on tips.
